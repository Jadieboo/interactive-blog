    <h1>Welcome to a blog about Jadie</h1>
    <h3>By Jade Sale</h3>
    <p>
        Who is Jadie? That's a question I've asked myself many times over the years. To start with, I'm a 32 year old woman who shares my life with my fiance, Danny and doggo Ollie. Throughout my 20s I lived life with the motto of "I'd like to do that someday" and "in the future I'll..." and "I've got time to...". Then one day, before I even realised it, I went from being 21 with time ahead of me to be being on the verge of turning 30 and realising all those wants and dreams of things I said I'd do or would like to someday do just never came. A decade of my life just came and went and I'd achieved nothing but the nagging feeling inside me of wanting to experience or achieve those goals are still with me, they never left. So I've set up a plan to spend my 30s making up for lost time. I want to go travelling, lose weight and overall live a healthier lifestyle, pursure a career in tech and participate in work that I am passionate about and own my own home.

        I struggled to find my place in the world. I've tried loads of different jobs/career paths and they were not for me. I always knew that I wanted to do something with computers but I didn't know what it was, I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I later found out, (hopefully not too late!) that software development was the thing I had been missing! I'm really passionate about technology, I like solving problems and I want to make an impact in something, regardless of the size of the impact.

        I've gone off on a tangent but basically what I'm trying to say is that I still don't fully know who I am and that's okay! I'm still growing and still learning how to navigate the world and live a happy and fulfilled life, but what I do know is I have a wonderful partner to explore this life with. I have the cutest dog who is literally my child! I love music, escaping into books, FOOD (a bit too much), video games and making spreadsheets haha! It's a journey and I'm plodding along.
